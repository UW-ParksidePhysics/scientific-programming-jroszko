%Goal is to plot a single graph of probability of a two state system, then later multiple graphs.
%Probality equals the multiplicity of the macrostate over the muliplicty of the entire system, which is in line 43
%N is the total amount of chances of the system and n being the secondary amount.(ex. total amount of coins flipped is 100(N), with 20 head and 80(n) tails.)
% multiplicity of the entire system is calculated use 2^N, 2 being there because its a two state system and N being the total amount of coins flipped.
% multiplicty of a macrostate is calculated using Omega=N!/n!*(N-n)!
%-later comment
% N (10:10:100):
%Previous code below
%N = (10:10:100)
%n = (0:1:N)
%plot(n,P)
%probability(n):
%function probability(n)
%hold on
%plot_probability(n)......
%hold off
%
%function plot_probability(n)
%   plot(n,P)

%% 1. Code runs without error, no error messages pop up.
%% 2. Output of the code is understandable and legible; very organized.
%% 3. Code itself is very readable, nothing is out of place.
%% 4. Code comments are organized and explain the process of the code.
%% 5. All variable names relate to the concept at hand (all formally adequate for the project)
%% 6. The range of variables captures the problem well, no issues.
%% 7. Visualizations show the problem well, graph shows up after running code, appears coherent.
